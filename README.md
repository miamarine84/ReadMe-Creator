ReadMe creator homework with node.js

Here I created a user friendly ReadMe creator that allows the user to provide a proper Readme file on GitHub which includes a quick Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and a final line where we allow anyone seeing the Readme communication info by asking us any questions through our Email.

We also show license badges for 3 pre-selected types(MIT, ISC and if the user chooses unlicensed)

Giving also a quick description that defines such license.....

Here is a quick video tutorial of how this quick node program works...
